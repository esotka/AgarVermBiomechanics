## data
### "architecture.csv"  
Individual_ID = code for each individual  
StacyLifehistory = morphological identification of reproductive tetrasporophytes vs vegetative  
Reproductive = Y/N  
countimages = the number of images used in WinRhizo  
sumlength = sum of all lengths (cm)  
Length = should the value be trusted (e.g., you got all the plant) Y/N  
sumprojarea = sum of the projected area (cm2)  
sumsurfarea  = sum of the projected area (cm2) * pi  
Surfacearea = should sumprojarea and sumsurfarea value be trusted (e.g., you got all the plant) Y/N  
sumavediam = sum of the diameters (cm)  
Diameter = should the value be trusted (e.g., you got all the plant) Y/N  
sumrtvol = sum of the volume (cm3)  
Volume = should the value be trusted (e.g., you got all the plant) Y/N  


### "breakage.csv"  
sample_id = code for each individual  
Breakage_Point = where in the thallus did the break happen (base, mid, top)  
attachment = was the individual attached in the field?  
attach2 = a modification of "attachment" column  
Life_History2 = morphological identification of reproductive tetrasporophytes vs vegetative  
slope_Mpa = maximum slope of stress-strain curve  
auc_modulus = area under the stress-strain curve  
maxstrain = max strain
